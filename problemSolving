what is an algorithm? 

A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

How do you improve?

1.devise a plan for solving problems 
2.master common problem soving patterns 

problem solving strats 

1.understand the problem 
2.explore concrete examples 
3.break it down 
4.solve/simplify 
5.look back and refactor 

#########################################

understand the problem 

can i restate the problem in my own words?
what are the inputs the go into the problem
what are the output that should come from the solutionto the proble 
can the outputs be determained from the input.
do i have enough information to solve the problem 
how should i lable the inportant pieces of data that are a part of the problem 


###############################################
explore concrete examples

come up with concrete examples 
coming up with them help you understand the problem better 

examples also provide sanity checks that you eventual solution works how it should 

####################################################
break it down 

explicitly writing down the steps that you need to take 

forces you to think about the code you will write before tou writ it, and 
helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to 
worry about details.... 

#####################################################
solve/simplify 

break down the solution into steps 

find the core diffuculty in what you are trying to do 
temp ignore that difficulty 
write a simplified solution
then incorporate that diff back in 


regex can be simplified to :


const isAlphaNumeric = (char) => {
    let code = char.charCodeAt(0)
    if(
        (code > 47 && code < 58 ) &&
        (code > 64 && code < 91 ) &&
        (code > 97 && code < 122 ) &&
        
    ){

        return true
    }

    return false

}
